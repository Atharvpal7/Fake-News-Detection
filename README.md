# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Introduction  
Fake news has become a major issue in today’s digital world. In this project, we built a machine learning model to classify news articles as **Real** or **Fake** using text processing techniques and ML algorithms.  

This project demonstrates:  
- Data preprocessing & visualization  
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF**  
- Training models (**Logistic Regression** & **Decision Tree**)  
- Evaluating model performance  
- Saving models for future predictions  
  
## 📊 Dataset  
We used a dataset containing labeled news articles:  
- **Label**: real or fake  
- **Text**: news article content  

Dataset was preprocessed to clean and vectorize the text for ML.  

## ⚙️ Steps in Project  

### 🔹 Data Preprocessing  
- Removed null values, cleaned text.  
- Converted labels to binary (1 = Real, 0 = Fake).  

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Word clouds for most frequent words.  
- Bar charts of word frequencies.  

### 🔹 Feature Extraction  
- Used **TF-IDF Vectorizer** to convert text to numerical features.  

### 🔹 Model Training  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**  

### 🔹 Evaluation  
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  

### 🔹 Model Saving  
- Saved both trained models (`.pkl` files).  
- Saved **TF-IDF Vectorizer** for re-use during prediction.  

## 📈 Results  

- **Logistic Regression Accuracy**:  
  - Train: **99.35%**  
  - Test: **98.97%**  

- **Decision Tree Accuracy**:  
  - Train: **100%**  
  - Test: **99.58%**  


## 🚀 Future Work  
- Improve model with **ensemble methods** (Random Forest, XGBoost).  
- Deploy the project as a **web app** (Flask/Streamlit).  
- Add more robust **text preprocessing** (stopwords removal, stemming/lemmatization).
